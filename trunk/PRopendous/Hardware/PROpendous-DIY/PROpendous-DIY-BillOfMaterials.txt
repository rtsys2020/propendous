Not yet complete.
Open the design in KiCAD and CVpcb will list footprint values for all components.


Notes:	- The LPC3130 can be replaced by the LPC3131
	- 1.2V Regulators: ZLDO11171.2   or  LD1117S12
	- 3V can be any adjustable 1117 regulator but check datasheet
	- LED can be any 0805 LED
	- for capacitors, only the 4.7uF input caps should be X5R +/-20% or better
	- for resistors, only those marked 1% should be 1%
